Recursion can be eligent but slow and repeating continious use of
same pattern is very resource hungry where as itterative solutions are generally more faster 
and more efficient for simple numeric problems Because they do calculations based on O(n) meaning 
it loops n times where as in recursion it runs the funcitons for 2 to the of n times. Which 
is way bigger when dealing with bigger numbers.
